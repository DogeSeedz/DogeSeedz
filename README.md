# DogeSeedz Core [DOGESEEDZ, ÐGSEEDZ]

![DogeSeedz](https://dogeseedz.com/dogeseedz.png)

DogeSeedz is a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, although it does not use SHA256 as
its proof of work (POW). Taking development cues from Tenebrix and Litecoin,
DogeSeedz currently employs a simplified variant of scrypt.

## Development and contributions – omg developers
Development is ongoing, and the development team, as well as other volunteers,
can freely work in their own trees and submit pull requests when features or
bug fixes are ready.

#### Version strategy
Version numbers are following ```major.minor.patch``` semantics.

#### Branches
There are 3 types of branches in this repository:

- **master:** Stable, contains the latest version of the latest *major.minor* release.
- **maintenance:** Stable, contains the latest version of previous releases, which are still under active maintenance. Format: ```<version>-maint```
- **development:** Unstable, contains new code for planned releases. Format: ```<version>-dev```

*Master and maintenance branches are exclusively mutable by release. Planned*
*releases will always have a development branch and pull requests should be*
*submitted against those. Maintenance branches are there for **bug fixes only,***
*please submit new features against the development branch with the highest version.*

#### Contributions ✍️

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`. Further details on running
and extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).

There are also [regression and integration tests](/qa) of the RPC interface, written
in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/qa) are installed) with: `qa/pull-tester/rpc-tests.py`

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.

## Very Much Frequently Asked Questions ❓

### How many DogeSeedz can exist?

Around block 1,000,000 there will be approximately 9,000,000,000 coins.
Each subsequent block will grant 100 coins to encourage miners to continue to
secure the network and make up for lost wallets on hard drives/phones/lost
encryption passwords/etc.


### Such mining information ⛏

DogeSeedz uses a simplified variant of the scrypt key derivation function as its
proof of work with a target time of 30 seconds per block and difficulty
readjustment after every block.  


**The current block reward schedule:**

Block 1 : 1000000000 DogeSeedz
Block 2 : 10000000 DogeSeedz
Block 10 : 10000 DogeSeedz
Block 100 : 100 DogeSeedz
Block 2880 : 500 DogeSeedz
Block 5760 : 1000 DogeSeedz
Block 11520 : 1500 DogeSeedz
Block 23040 : 5000 DogeSeedz
Block 46080 : 7500 DogeSeedz
Block 50000 : 9000 DogeSeedz
Block 100000 : 10000 DogeSeedz
Block 200000 : 15000 DogeSeedz
Block 300000 : 20000 DogeSeedz
Block 400000 : 25000 DogeSeedz
Block 500000 : 10000 DogeSeedz
Block 1000000 : 100 DogeSeedz

## Development tips and tricks

**compiling for debugging**

Run `configure` with the `--enable-debug` option, then `make`. Or run `configure` with
`CXXFLAGS="-g -ggdb -O0"` or whatever debug flags you need.

**debug.log**

If the code is behaving strangely, take a look in the debug.log file in the data directory;
error and debugging messages are written there.

The `-debug=...` command-line option controls debugging; running with just `-debug` will turn
on all categories (and give you a very large debug.log file).

The Qt code routes `qDebug()` output to debug.log under category "qt": run with `-debug=qt`
to see it.

**testnet and regtest modes**

Run with the `-testnet` option to run with "play DogeSeedzs" on the test network, if you
are testing multi-machine code that needs to operate across the internet.

If you are testing something that can run on one machine, run with the `-regtest` option.
In regression test mode, blocks can be created on-demand; see qa/rpc-tests/ for tests
that run in `-regtest` mode.

**DEBUG_LOCKORDER**

DogeSeedz Core is a multithreaded application, and deadlocks or other multithreading bugs
can be very difficult to track down. Compiling with `-DDEBUG_LOCKORDER` (`configure
CXXFLAGS="-DDEBUG_LOCKORDER -g"`) inserts run-time checks to keep track of which locks
are held, and adds warnings to the debug.log file if inconsistencies are detected.
